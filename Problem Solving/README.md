## 🎯 Problem-Solving Approaches

1. **Understand the Problem**
   - Clarify requirements and constraints
   - Identify edge cases
   - Restate the problem in your own words

2. **Plan Your Approach**
   - Break down the problem
   - Consider different approaches
   - Choose the most efficient solution

3. **Implement the Solution**
   - Write clean, efficient code
   - Use appropriate data structures
   - Handle edge cases

4. **Test and Optimize**
   - Verify correctness with test cases
   - Analyze time and space complexity
   - Look for optimization opportunities

## 🎓 Learning Path

1. Master basic data structures (arrays, strings, linked lists)
2. Learn common algorithms (sorting, searching)
3. Practice with coding challenges (LeetCode, HackerRank)
4. Study system design principles
5. Participate in coding competitions (Codeforces, CodeChef)
6. Review and analyze others' solutions
