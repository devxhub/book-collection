# 🌐 Distributed Systems

Welcome to the **Distributed Systems** section! This category covers the design, implementation, and challenges of systems that consist of multiple networked computers working together.

## 📖 Topics Covered

- **Distributed Algorithms** - Consensus, leader election, clock synchronization
- **Consistency Models** - Strong, eventual, causal consistency
- **Distributed Storage** - Replication, partitioning, CAP theorem
- **Message Passing** - RPC, message queues, publish-subscribe
- **Fault Tolerance** - Failure detection, recovery, Byzantine faults
- **Distributed Transactions** - 2PC, 3PC, Saga pattern
- **Microservices Architecture** - Design and deployment patterns

## 🏗️ Key Concepts

1. **Consensus** - Getting multiple nodes to agree
2. **Partitioning** - Distributing data across nodes
3. **Replication** - Maintaining multiple copies of data
4. **Consistency** - Ensuring data remains accurate
5. **Fault Tolerance** - Handling node/network failures
6. **Scalability** - Handling increased load
7. **Latency** - Managing communication delays
