# 💻 Operating Systems

Welcome to the **Operating Systems** section! This category covers the fundamental concepts, design, and implementation of operating systems.

## 📖 Topics Covered

- **Process Management** - Processes, threads, scheduling
- **Memory Management** - Virtual memory, paging, segmentation
- **File Systems** - Storage, organization, access methods
- **I/O Systems** - Device management, drivers
- **Concurrency** - Synchronization, deadlocks
- **Security & Protection** - Access control, authentication
- **Distributed Systems** - Networking, distributed file systems

## 🏗️ Core Components

1. **Kernel** - Core of the OS, manages system resources
2. **Process Manager** - Handles process creation and scheduling
3. **Memory Manager** - Manages RAM and virtual memory
4. **File System** - Handles file storage and retrieval
5. **Device Drivers** - Interface with hardware devices
6. **System Calls** - Interface between user programs and the OS
7. **User Interface** - Command-line or graphical interface
